# Anglish-Keyboard
A Custom Keyboard That Both Adds New Letters and Replaces Newer Letters For Older Counterparts, Which I Chose To Publicize So Other People Can Access And Use Custom Keys Too.

# What Does This Change?
A Couple Thing Are Different To The Standard Keyboard As You Would Expect So I'll Just List It Out;

| Keys | Replacement | Modifiers |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| W/w | Ƿ/ƿ | None[^1] |
| T/t | þ/Þ | AltGr |
| Y/y | Ȝ/ȝ | NONE[^1] |
| O/o | Œ/œ | AltGr |
| A/a | Æ/æ | AltGr |
| S/s | ſ/NONE[^2] | AltGr |
| D/d | Ð/ð | AltGr |
| X/x | ⁊/& | AltGr |
| N/n | Ŋ/ŋ | AltGr |
- To Access AltGr, Hold Down The Right Alt Button On Your Keyboard When Typing The Letters You Want To Use.

[^1]:These Here Replace The Default Keys On The Keyboard Meaning You Won't Be Able To Type Neither "W" Nor "Y".
[^2]:There Is No Capitalised Version Of This Letter As It Would Just Be Replaced With A Regular Curved "S".

## Q & A
**Q**: The Keyboards [#] And ["] Are Inverted
**A**: You Are Most Likely Using A US Keyboard And This Keyboard Base Is A UK Style Keyboard.
